VoIP_Server_Project
===================
The purpose of this repository is to document the steps
I took to create Voice Over Ip through the use of the Raspberry Pi.
The Pi is meant to act as a router, which manages the the IP address of 
multiple devices, in my case two soft phones. The end goal is to be able to 
make phone calls between the two phones without any hassle.
